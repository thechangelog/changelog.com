Let's dig into how all the above pieces fit together.


## A three-tier monolith

TL;DR:
- **Front-end**
  - Fastly
  - Fly.io Proxy
  - AWS S3
- **Application**
  - Elixir / Phoenix
- **Database**
  - PostgreSQL

[changelog.com](https://changelog.com) is a monolithic
[Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) application built with the
[Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org) web framework. It uses
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) for persistence &
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to digest & compile static assets (CSS & JS).

Static assets, including all our mp3 episodes, are stored on AWS S3. They are
served via Fastly, specifically https://cdn.changelog.com. In summary:

```
Fastly (cdn.changelog.com)
â†“
AWS S3 (changelog-assets.s3.amazonaws.com)
````

The production instance of our application is running on Fly.io. All
https://changelog.com requests are served via Fastly. Each Fastly request gets
proxied to our application instance via the Fly.io Proxy. In summary:

```
Fastly (changelog.com)
â†“
Fly.io Proxy
â†“
Application (changelog-2022-03-13.fly.dev)
```

The production database - PostgreSQL - is running on Fly.io too. It is a
replicated setup, with one leader & one replica. In summary:

```
Application (changelog-2022-03-13.fly.dev)
â†“
PostgreSQL Leader
â†“
PostgreSQL Replica
```


## Production deploys

Each commit made against our primary branch gets deployed straight into
production. The ["Ship It!" GitHub Actions
workflow](.github/workflows/ship_it.yml) is responsible for this. From the
workflow jobs perspective, it is fairly standard:

- **1/3. Package**
  - [Uses Dagger.io](https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com/pull/395) so that it works exactly the same locally as it does in GitHub Actions
  - [Connects to a Docker Engine running on Fly.io](https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com/pull/416) so that caching is reliable & persistent between runs
  - A successful run publishes a container image to Docker Hub
- **2/3. Deploy**
  - Uses `flyctl` GitHub Action to deploy to Fly.io if **Package** succeeds
- **3/3. Notify**
  - Notifies `#dev` channel in changelog.slack.com if **Deploy** succeeds

Most of our pipeline complexity - building, testing, digesting assets &
publishing the resulting container image - is encapsulated in Dagger.io, which
runs in GitHub Actions as **1/3. Package**. One of the primary benefits is that
this part works in CI exactly as it does locally. Here is an overview of what
happens inside our Dagger.io pipeline:

```
                 app
                 |
                 v
test_db_start    deps ----------------------------------------\
|                |                      |                     |
|                v                      v                     v
|                deps_compile_test      deps_compile_prod     assets_compile
|                |                      |               |     |
|                |                      |               \-----|
|                v                      v                     |
\--------------> test                   image_prod_cache      assets_digest
                 |                      |                     |
test_db_stop <---|                      v                     |
                 |                      image_prod <----------/
                 |                      |
                 |                      v
                 \--------------------> image_prod_tag
```


## Secrets

All our secrets are stored in [1Password](https://changelog.1password.com/), in
the **Shared** Vault. Currently, they are manually declared in Fly.io via
`flyctl`. They are pasted manually in [GitHub Actions
secrets](https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com/settings/secrets/actions).


## Metrics & observability

Since our application & database are running on Fly.io, we benefit from free
infrastructure metrics: https://fly-metrics.net

All logs from Fastly are streamed into Honeycomb.io. This allows us to ask
unknown questions about how various HTTP clients interact with our content. It
also helps us explore how Fastly interacts with Fly.io.

All app errors - e.g. `Plug.Conn.InvalidQueryError` - show up in Sentry.io.

Pingdom.com monitors our public HTTPS endpoints & alerts us when they become unhealthy.


## What is missing?

The above is what we have so far. While we like to keep things simple, our
setup is a constant work in progress. We keep making small improvements all the
time, and we talk about them every 10 weeks in the context of our [Ship It!
Kaizen episodes](https://changelog.com/topic/kaizen). For example, this diagram
and document were created in the context of [ðŸŽ§ Kaizen 8: 24 improvements & a
lot more](https://shipit.show/80). If you would prefer to stay in reading mode,
check out [GitHub discussion
#433](https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com/discussions/433).

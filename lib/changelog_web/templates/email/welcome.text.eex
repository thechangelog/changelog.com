Hey <%= PersonView.first_name(@person) %>,

Welcome to the Changelog Community!

Sign in to your account to access our Slack, manage your email subscriptions, and complete your profile.

We don't use passwords. Each time you sign in we’ll send you a temporary link to your email address. That’s one less password to worry about (yay!). Here’s your first one:

<%= AuthView.auth_url(Endpoint, @person) %>


This link will self-destruct in <%= auth_link_expires_in(@person) %>.

Already Expired? Request a new link: <%= sign_in_url(Endpoint, :new) %>

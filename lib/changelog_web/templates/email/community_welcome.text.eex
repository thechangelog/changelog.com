We don't use passwords. Each time you sign in weâ€™ll send you a temporary link to your email address. Thatâ€™s one less password to worry about (yay!). Hereâ€™s your first one:

<%= AuthView.auth_url(Endpoint, @person) %>


This link will self-destruct in <%= auth_link_expires_in(@person) %>.

Already Expired? Request a new link: <%= sign_in_url(Endpoint, :new) %>

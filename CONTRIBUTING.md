## How can I contribute?

We prefer small incremental changes that can be reviewed and merged quickly.
It's OK if it takes multiple pull requests to close an issue.

Each improvement should land in our primary branch within a few hours.
The sooner we can get multiple people looking at and agreeing on a specific change, the quicker we will have it out in production.
The quicker we can get these small improvements in production, the quicker we can find out what doesn't work, or what we have missed.

The added benefit is that this will force everyone to think about handling partially implemented features & non-breaking changes.
Both are great approaches, and in our 10years+ experience, they work really well in practice.

## How do I run the application locally?

You will need to have the following dependencies installed:
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) v15
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) v1.14
- [Erlang/OTP](https://www.erlang.org/downloads) v26 - usually installed as an Elixir dependency
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v20 LTS - [latest-v20.x](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v20.x/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) v1.22
- [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) v1.20 - if you want to run CI locally

We are using [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) to install the correct dependency versions in our development environment.

This is what that looks like on macOS 12, our usual development environment:

```console
# 🛠 INSTALL DEPENDENCIES 🛠
awk '{ system("asdf plugin-add " $1) }' < .tool-versions
asdf install

# - Erlang v26.2
# - Golang 1.20.12
# - Node.js v20.10.0
# - Yarn v1.22.19
# - PostgreSQL v15.3

# You will also need to install imagemagick via Homebrew.
# asdf imagemagick plugin did not work for me.
brew install imagemagick

## How to upgrade 💜 Elixir, 🚜 Erlang/OTP & ⬢ Node.js?

1. Run e.g. `asdf install erlang latest:26`
    - If a new version gets installed, run `asdf local erlang <INSTALLED_VERSION>`
2. Repeat previous step for Elixir & Node.js
3. Commit & push to check that image builds successfully in GitHub Actions
    - _Alternatively_, build the image locally via: `{ cd magefiles && go run main.go -w ../ image:runtime }`

After you confirm that the image builds successfully:
1. Update `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` with new image tag
2. Ensure that Elixir minor version in `mix.exs` is accurate
3. Update Elixir, Erlang/OTP & Node.js version in `CONTRIBUTING.md` (this file)

Commit and push everything, then wait for all GitHub Actions checks to go green
✅ . At this point, one of the maintainers will review, approve & merge this
change. Thank you very much!

## Using GitHub Codespaces

A pre-configured Codespace can be launched for this repo by following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository). Everything you need to start contributing is installed and the following commands will start the site:

```console
# CONFIGURE APP
mix deps.get
mix ecto.setup

# CONFIGURE STATIC ASSETS
cd assets
yarn install

# RUN APP
mix phx.server
```

### Codespaces + VS Code Web Editor

If you are developing in the VS Code web editor two extra steps are required for the site to be able to load static assets correctly. Port forwarding utilizes a dynamic HTTPS `*.preview.app.github.dev` URL when developing in the web editor.

1. Set the `CODESPACES_WEB` environment variable. This tells the app to construct appropriate static asset paths.

   ```console
   export CODESPACES_WEB=true
   ```

2. After running the app the URL it is exposed on is visible in the `Toggle Ports` VS Code view (port 4000). Launch that URL and configure your browser to allow it to load insecure content via the instructions [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/vec/troubleshoot-composer/mixed-content.html). This is necessary to allow js/css to be accessible over HTTP when the `*.preview.app.github.dev` site is using HTTPS.

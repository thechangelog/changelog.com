    <div class="content_body">

<p>Please read this document carefully before accessing or using The Changelog.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>English, not Legalese.</h3>

<p>Most Terms of Service and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written by and for lawyers, and in our opinion, they are not very effective.</p>

<p>Because we believe in establishing long-term relationships with our readers and listeners, we decided to use plain English instead, to make our terms as clear as possible.</p>

<p>Please don't forget that we are real people: take a look at our company page to get to know us a little. We're not perfect, but we're trying, and we genuinely care about you.</p>

<p>When you read "The Changelog" or "we" as mentioned in this document, it refers to changelog.com (contact information), its affiliates and agents.</p>

<p>Should you have other questions or concerns about this document, please get in touch <a href="http://thechangelog.com/contact/">using our contact form</a> or <a href="https://github.com/thechangelog/legal/issues/new">by submitting an issue on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Terms of Service</h2>

<p>Using The Changelog means accepting these terms.</p>

<p>By accessing, using, reading, or listening to The Changelog in any way, you agree to and are bound by the terms and conditions written in this document.</p>

<p>If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this document, do not access The Changelog.</p>

<h3>Breach of Terms</h3>

<p>If you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document, your authorization to access or use The Changelog automatically terminates. Any materials downloaded or printed from The Changelog in violation of the Terms of Use must be immediately destroyed.</p>

<p>We may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of The Changelog at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you. To this day, we have never had to do this, and we hope it never happens.</p>

<p>If you think we removed your access by mistake, get in touch and we'll give you our reasoning. We also have the ability to restore access without losing any data.</p>

<h3>Support</h3>

<p>Support for The Changelog is provided by <a href="http://thechangelog.com/contact/">using our contact form</a>.</p>

<h3>Access to your data</h3>

<h4>What personal data do we collect and why?</h4>

<p>We collect the following personal data:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Email address</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not collect your address or credit card information directly. See the question "Who can see my credit card number?" below.</p>

<p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>

<p>Please be aware that your browser must be enabled to accept cookies from changelog.com in order for you to use The Changelog.</p>

<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above.</p>

<h4>Who can see my password?</h4>

<p>No one. We never store your password unencrypted, so no one can read it.</p>

<p>It is your sole responsibility to keep your user name, password and other sensitive information confidential. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, you shall notify The Changelog immediately.</p>

<p>If you forget your password, we send you a secure link via email that lets you reset it.</p>

<h4>Who can see my credit card number?</h4>

<p>No one at The Changelog. We use the very trustworthy and secure Stripe payment service. Read <a href="https://stripe.com/us/terms">Stripe's Terms of Service</a> to learn more about their security measures. In short, they encrypt your credit card information.</p>

<h4>Our commitment to children's privacy</h4>

<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>

<h4>How can I access or correct my information?</h4>

<p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging in to The Changelog site you have access to and visiting the settings pages.</p>

<h4>What are the guidelines The Changelog follows when accessing my data?</h4>

<ul>
<li>We restrict access to customer data to only senior members of The Changelog, and never to outside contractors</li>
<li>We only do it in response to a customer support question</li>
<li>We only do it in order to debug and fix the issue</li>
<li>We never make changes to anything unless explicitly requested by a site owner</li>
<li>We never ever ever share what we see with other customers or the general public</li>
<li>We might give access to US authorities if requested in writing. We'll try not to, but we don't have the resources to fight the government.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How is my data protected from another customer's data?</h4>

<p>All of our customers' data resides in the same database. We use software best practices to guarantee only people who you designate as viewers of your data can access it. In other words, we segment our customer data via software. We do our best and are very confident we're doing a good job at it, but, like every other web software that hosts customer data in the same database, we cannot guarantee a highly sophisticated hacker cannot access other people's data.</p>

<h4>How are you protecting my data from hacker attacks?</h4>

<p>All of our servers are highly physically secured at DigitalOcean's data centers. We also have our own practices in place, which follow the industry's best practices. We keep our servers always up to date with security fixes, have one-click ways to take down servers should they become infected/compromised and to create and deploy new clean ones.</p>

<h4>What should I do if I find a security vulnerability in The Changelog?</h4>

<p>If you have discovered a security concern, please contact us immediately <a href="http://thechangelog.com/contact/">using our contact form</a>. We'll work with you to make sure that we understand the scope of the issue, and that we fully address your concern. We consider correspondence sent through our contact form the highest priority, and work to address any issues that arise as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Please act in good faith towards our users' privacy and data during your disclosure. We won't take legal action against you or administrative action against your account if you act accordingly: White hat researchers are always appreciated.</p>

<h3>Intellectual Property Rights</h3>

<h4>Who owns The Changelog materials?</h4>

<p>The Changelog materials are all the information, data, documents (e.g. white papers, press releases, datasheets, FAQs, etc.), communications, downloads, files, text, images, photographs, graphics, videos, webcasts, publications, content, tools, resources, software, code, programs and products on The Changelog produced by The Changelog.</p>

<p>You agree that you will not decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the software. Any copying or redistribution of the software is prohibited, including any copying or reproduction of the software to any other server or location for further reproduction, redistribution or use on a service bureau basis. Any unauthorized use, copying or distribution of the software is expressly prohibited by law, and may result in severe civil and criminal penalties. Violators will be prosecuted to the maximum extent possible.</p>

<p>The trademarks, logos and service marks displayed on this Site are the property of changelog.com or other third parties.

<p>The Changelog reserves the right to revoke the authorization to view, download and print The Changelog materials available via The Changelog at any time, and any such use shall be discontinued immediately upon notice from The Changelog.</p>

<p>The rights granted to you constitute a license and not a transfer of title.</p>

<p>Any The Changelog materials made available only upon payment of a fee may only be viewed, downloaded and printed subject to your payment of such fee.</p>

<h3>Reliability</h3>

<h4>Do you guarantee that The Changelog will be accessible at all times?</h4>

<p>In short, we do not. Like all other cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable to the inherent unreliability of the Internet.</p>

<p>We monitor The Changelog closely and have set up automated alerts to be notified when The Changelog service is under stress, so that we can deal with the issue before it becomes a problem that might impact customer access.</p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that The Changelog shall not be liable for any failure to store your materials on The Changelog at any time.</p>

<h3>Play Nice Clauses</h3>

<p>Materials and Services provided by third parties are governed by separate agreements accompanying such materials and services. The Changelog offers no guarantees and assumes no responsibility or liability of any type with respect to the third-party services, including any liability resulting from incompatibility between a third-party service, The Changelog materials, The Changelog service or another third-party service. You agree that you will not hold The Changelog responsible or liable with respect to the third-party services.</p>

<h4>Special Treatment for Spammers</h4>

<p>In the event of your or others' access to or use of The Changelog service in connection with the transmission of spam unsolicited email or postings in violation of these Terms of Use, you acknowledge and agree that The Changelog would be irreparably harmed thereunder and that monetary damages would be an insufficient and ineffective remedy; therefore you agree that The Changelog is entitled to obtain immediate injunctive relief against any such transmission (in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity). The Changelog may without restriction block, filter or delete unsolicited email.</p>

<h4>Restriction and Termination of Use</h4>

<p>The Changelog may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of The Changelog at any time in The Changelog's sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you.</p>

The Changelog will investigate notices of copyright infringement and take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(2) ("DMCA").</p>

<p>If you believe that your work has been used or copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and such infringement is occurring on The Changelog or on sites linked to from The Changelog, please provide written notification of claimed copyright infringement to the designated agent for The Changelog (identified below), which must contain the following elements:</p>

</ul>

<h4>Links to Third Party Sites</h4>

<p>The Changelog may include links that will take you to other sites outside of The Changelog service. The linked sites are provided by The Changelog to you as a convenience and the inclusion of the links do not imply any endorsement by The Changelog of any linked site. The Changelog has no control of the linked sites and you therefore acknowledge and agree that The Changelog is not responsible for the contents of any linked site, any link contained in a linked site or any changes or updates to a linked site. You further acknowledge and agree that The Changelog is not responsible for any form of transmission (e.g. webcasting) received from any linked site.</p>

You acknowledge and agree that The Changelog is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of such non-The Changelog advertisers on The Changelog.</p>

<h3>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>

<p>The Changelog service (excluding linked sites) is controlled by changelog.com from its offices within the state of Texas, United States of America.

<h3>General</h3>

<p>The Terms of Use and other rules, guidelines, licenses and disclaimers posted via The Changelog or in connection with the Materials and Services constitute the entire agreement between The Changelog and you with respect to your access to or use of The Changelog service and materials superseding any prior agreements between you and The Changelog on such subject matter (including any prior versions of the Terms of Use). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any terms set forth in the Terms of Use expressly contradict any terms of a written agreement between you and The Changelog regarding the use of specific Services or Materials (including Service-specific terms of use and Software-specific licenses) ("Executed Agreement"), such contradictory terms set forth in the Executed Agreement shall govern. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use other The Changelog services, third party content or third party software. You may not assign or otherwise transfer the Terms of Use nor any right granted hereunder without The Changelog's prior written consent. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms of Use, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties as reflected by that provision, and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue in full force and effect. Any failure by The Changelog to enforce or exercise any provision of the Terms of Use or related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. The section titles used in the Terms of Use are purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or contractual effect.</p>
